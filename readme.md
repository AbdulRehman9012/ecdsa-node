## ECDSA Node

I have updated this project and changed it's light mode to dark mode.

You have to provide private key of your account to transfer fund but don't worry your address is automatically founded and only shared with server not your private key. 
And for transfer function you only had to provide address for receiver account.

PRIVATE KEYS OF THREE ALREADY SAVED ACCOUNTS IS SHARED AT THE LAST OF THIS FILE YOU CAN TRY THOSE ACCOUNTS.
DON'T TRANSFER FUNDS IN THOSE ACCOUNT OF WHOM PRIVATE KEY IS NOT KNOWN.
 
### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
